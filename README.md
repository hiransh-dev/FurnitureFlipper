## Implementation

- ### üîê Authentication & Authorization with Passport

  - #### üìú Listings

    - Anyone can perform Read Operations
    - A logged in user can Create a Listing
    - The Author of the Listing can perform Update & Delete operations

  - #### ‚ùì Questions

    - Anyone can perform Read Operations on both Questions & Answers
    - A Logged in user can create a Question
    - The Author of the Question can perform a Delete operation.

  - SanitizeHTML package is used as an extension for the Joi Schema to prevent any HTML tags from entering the Database.

- ### üñºÔ∏è Multer middleware

  - Multer middleware is used for handling multipart/form-data for file uploads & file validations like Size, Limit & Mimetypes to only support. (Upto 4 Image files of type JPG/JPEG/PNG each within 4MB).

- ### üó∫Ô∏è Leaflet & OpenStreetMaps

  - Leaflet to set markers on the map & get longitude/latitude data for a new listing & later use it for current page listing on a Map or All listings on a Map & Map page.

  - Leaflet works with OpenStreetMaps to fetch Map tiles through their API.

- ### üõ°Ô∏è Common Security safeguards

  - ### ‚õëÔ∏è Helmet

    Helmet is used to set various HTTP Headers & protect against common attacks like XSS.

  - ### üßº SanitizeHTML

    SanitizeHTML for a simple way to sanitize data inputs for HTML to prevent XSS.

  - ### üßº ExpressMongoSanitize

    To sanitize all user inputs and removing any characters that could be used to perform a NoSQL injection attack.

  - Masonry to build an Image grid.
  - Method-Override to handle PUT/DELETE requests in Form submissions.
